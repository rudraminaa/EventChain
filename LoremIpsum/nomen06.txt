Yes pup's name is olaf.

Olaf the puppy woke up excited. Today was the big Puppy Carnival! Puppies ran everywhere, chasing colorful balloons and playing fun games. Olaf raced through tunnels, jumped over small hurdles, and barked at squeaky toys. He even won a little ribbon for being the fastest pup. By the end of the day, Olaf was tired but very happy, wagging his tail all the way home.
