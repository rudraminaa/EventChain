This New Year I made few resolutions: I'll wake up at 6, go and hit the gym, maintain a checklist and make sure to complete every tasks before I sleep. Ofcourse, It didn't last more than a day, and the reason it failed was the late night meet-up with my friends on 1st. It was fun anyway, I won't trade that night for anything. We travelled through crowded streets before leading to hills and valleys just to realise we are now 80 miles from our town and decided to stay there and play cards. Everything went fun, We enjoyed the best time and there can't be a better way to start this year.
